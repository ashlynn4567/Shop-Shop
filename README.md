# Shop-Shop
This is my fourteenth project for the University of Oregon Coding Bootcamp 2022. In this project, I use the MERN stack to enhance an existing e-commerce platform. In this application, users can add items to their personalized shopping cart, use the app offline, and process secure payments through Stripe.
