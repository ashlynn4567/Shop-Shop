# Shop-Shop
This is my fourteenth project for the University of Oregon Coding Bootcamp 2022. In this project, I use the MERN stack to enhance an existing e-commerce platform. Users can add items to their personalized shopping cart, use the app offline, and process secure payments through Stripe. Later, this application was refactored to use Redux.
